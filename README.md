# Giverr is an app for the homeless

An ambitious project to do something meaningful for the less fortunate.

## Basic premise:

The general public can use this app to donate funds to a central account, which food and service partners (think McDonalds, Subway, gas stations, etc) can charge against for cost of goods given to people in need.

Similar to the [Safe Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Safe_Place) initiative, Giverr seeks to be an accessible, no-agenda, politically-agnostic way for people in difficult life situations to get essentials like food, water, and clothing that they might otherwise not receive.

### How you can help:

If you're a developer, this project is open source and ready for you to contribute to. The process will take some time to smooth out, but done is better than perfect.

Join the discussion on Slack to better collaborate and bounce ideas around: [Join the Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/giverr/shared_invite/enQtNTYwOTcxNjg1OTc0LWU4MWVhNjU4NjNhZGI3OTRjN2Y4ZjE4NjgyNWU2NmQ2MjFjNWFkNzdiMWU3ODM5MmE2M2Y3NGUyZmQxNjZjMmQ)

There's also a Trello board for the project which active contributors will be invited to, though it's publicly visible so everyone can see what's being done: [Giverr Trello board](https://trello.com/b/DOcSNShy/giverr-app)
